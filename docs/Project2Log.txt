Massaged grammar. Removed ambiguity (most of the ambiguity resulted from changes to the Pascal grammar made in Project 2's description). I spent a lot of time trying to find an ambiguity in the nested subprograms addition to the project requirements, but as it turns out there isn't an ambiguity here. Since since all subprograms must start with a <subprogram_head> and they all must end with a <compound_statement>. Both of those non-terminals must produce some terminals (function id for <subprogram_head> and begin and end for <compound_statement>).
